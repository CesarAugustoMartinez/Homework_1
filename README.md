## Criteria

When I viewed the source code in the webpage and I found non-semantic elements like <div> and <span>, Which tells nothing about its content. Although their elements had a class named with a meaning. 

Then I replace these with semantic elements. I describe below wich semantic elements were used.

<header> It contains the logo and a set of navigational links.  
<nav> It is inside of the header and defines a set of navigation links.
<article> It is inside of two elements which have articles with independent, self-contained.
<section> It was used to define the section that has a class named "content".
<aside> It was used to define the element that has a class named "benefits" and It is at the right side on the webpage. 
<mark> It was used to create the word "Horiseon" with a different color in the letters "seo".
<footer> It defines the footer of the web page.
<figure> It was used to specifies the photo at the top of the webpage.
